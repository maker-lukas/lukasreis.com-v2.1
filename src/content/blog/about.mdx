import Progress from '../../components/Progress.astro';

## Hey again!
I'm Lukas, a maker who enjoys building cool things. When I'm not coding, I'm either breathing solder fumes, gaming, reading, or listening to music way too loud.

I'm a sibling of 5 and Finnish by birth. Portuguese by choice. Surfer by obsession.
