**Hack Club** is a global network of teen hackers and makers who build, code, and collaborate.

## What Hack Club Means To Me

> Hack Club changed my life

> — Me

It sounds big, but it's true. Before Hack Club, I mostly spent my time watching videos and playing games. After joining I started making real projects that I'm actually proud of. I learned how to code, make PCBs, solder, and actually ship good projects.

Here are a few moments from Hack Club

### Attending a 24-hour hackathon

Scrapyard was a in person, 24-hour Hack Club hackathon organized in 100+ cities for teenagers 18 and under.

I attended the Lisbon event on February 14-15, 2025, hosted at Cloudflare. I met some of the coolest people I know there. Even though my "scrappy" project didn't turn out great, I don't really care. I spent 24-hours building, learning, and hanging out with people that were just as nerdy and excited as I was. It was one of the best experiences I've had.

### Meeting a new friend

On October 14, 2025, someone I'd seen around on Slack DMed me. We were talking casually when he asked if I lived in my city. Somehow he did too for a third of the year and we were just 6 km apart.

I didn't believe it at first and asked for proof. And he gave me. We stayed up talking for a few hours, and when I woke up in the morning, I actually thought it had been a dream. It wasn't. We met up later that day, and at first it was awkward but then we got along. Over the next days, we hung out, coded, made cool projects.
